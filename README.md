```



# Operational UX Once Running 

_Assumes no port set, default port for operation webserver is 27020_


## Launch the Verifier Binary

To see all options: 


```
./migration_verifier --help
```


To check all namespaces: 


```
./migration_verifier --srcURI mongodb://127.0.0.1:27002 --dstURI mongodb://127.0.0.1:27003 --metaURI mongodb://127.0.0.1:27001 --metaDBName verify_meta --verifyAll  
```


To filter namespaces (allow list): 


```
./migration_verifier --srcURI mongodb://127.0.0.1:27002 --dstURI mongodb://127.0.0.1:27003 --metaURI mongodb://127.0.0.1:27001 --metaDBName verify_meta --srcNamespace foo.bar --dstNamespace foo.bar --srcNamespace foo.yar --dstNamespace foo.yar --srcNamespace mixed.namespaces --dstNamespace can.work
```


Note: that this will check from` foo.bar <-> foo.bar, foo.yar <-> foo.yar, `and` mixed.namespaces <-> can.work`

For checking namespaces with differing names between source and destination, the namespaces must be explicitly enumerated on the command line with the` --srcNamespace and --dstNamespace` flags. Names in the same position are considered to be the same:


```
migration-verifier … --srcNamespace foo.bar --srcNamespace foo.baz --dstNamespace foo.bar1 --dstNamespace bar.bar2 
```


will result in the mapping `foo.bar <-> foo.bar1, foo.baz <-> bar.bar2`

By default, the verifier will read from all nodes (primary and secondary).  This can be changed with option “`--readPreference <preference>`” where `<preference>` can be “`primary`”, “`secondary`”, “`primaryPreferred`”, “`secondaryPreferred`”, or “`nearest`” (same as default).  

To set a port, use `--serverPort <port number>`. The default is 27020.


## Send the Verifier Process Commands: 



1. After launching the verifier (see above), you can send it requests to get it to start verifying. The verification process is started by using the `check`command. The verification process will keep running until you tell the verifier to stop. It will keep track of the inconsistencies it has found and will keep checking those inconsistencies hoping that eventually they will resolve.

    ```
    curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{}' http://127.0.0.1:27020/api/v1/check
    ```


2. Once mongosync has committed the replication, you can tell the verifier that writes have stopped. You can see the state of mongosync’s replication by hitting mongosync’s `progress` endpoint and checking that the state is `COMMITTED`. See the documentation [here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/cluster-to-cluster-sync/current/reference/api/progress/#response). \
The verifier will now check to completion to make sure that there are no inconsistencies. The command you need to send the verifier to tell it that the replication is committed is `writesOff`. The command doesn’t block. This means that you will have to poll the verifier to see the status of the verification (see `progress`).

    ```
    curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{}' http://127.0.0.1:27020/api/v1/writesOff
    ```


3. You can poll the status of the verification by hitting the `progress`endpoint. In particular, the `phase`should reveal whether the verifier is done verifying; once the `phase`is `idle`the verification has completed. When the `phase`has reached `idle`, the `error`field should be `null`and the `failedTasks`field should be `0`, if the verification was successful. A non-`null``error`field indicates that the verifier itself ran into an error. `failedTasks`being non-`0`indicates that there was an inconsistency. The logs printed by the verifier itself should have more information regarding what the inconsistencies are.

    ```
    curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X GET http://127.0.0.1:27020/api/v1/progress

    ```


	

	This is a sample output when inconsistencies are present:


    	`{"progress":{"phase":"idle","error":null,"verificationStatus":{"totalTasks":1,"addedTasks":0,"processingTasks":0,"failedTasks":1,"completedTasks":0,"metadataMismatchTasks":0,"recheckTasks":0}}}`


# Limitation

The verifier’s iterative process can handle data changes while it is running, until you hit the writesOff endpoint.  However, it cannot handle DDL commands.  If the verifier receives a DDL change stream event (drop, dropDatabase, rename), the verification will fail.  If an untracked DDL event (create, createIndexes, dropIndexes, modify) occurs, the verifier may miss the change. 


# Benchmarking Results

Ran on m6id.metal + M40 with 3 replica sets

Command run python3 ./test/benchmark.py --way=recheck remote

When running with 1TB of random data on 3 collections

**In recheck and normal mode it runs at 1.5-2.5gbps per replica** and is **disk bound on each node** (meaning there are not of easy optimizations to make this faster) \
On default settings it used about **200GB of RAM on m6id.metal machine when using all the cores**

**This means it does about 1TB/20min but it is HIGHLY dependent on the source and dest machines**


# How the Verifier Works

The migration-verifier has two steps:



1. The initial check
    1. The verifier partitions up the data into 400MB (configurable) chunks and spins up many worker goroutines (threads) to read from both the source and destination.
    2. The verifier compares the documents on the source and destination by bytes and if they are different, it then checks field by field in case the field ordering has changed (since field ordering isn't required to be the same for the migration to be a success)

2. Iterative checking
    1. Since writes are coming in while the verification is happening, the verifier could both miss problematic changes made by the migration tool and could have temporary inconsistencies  that will clean themselves up later
    2. Before starting the initial check, the verifier starts a change stream on the source and keeps track of every document that is modified on the source
    3. In addition, the verifier keeps track of any documents that fail a check
    4. The verifier runs rounds of checks continuously until it is told that writes are off, fetching the documents stored from the change stream and that were inconsistent in the previous checking rounds, from both the source and destination and rechecking them. Once again, violations are written down for future checking rounds
    5. Every document to check is written with a generation number. A checking round checks documents for a specific generation. When a check round begins, we start writing new documents with a new generation number
    6. The verifier fetches all collection/index/view information on the source and destination and confirms they are identical in every generation. This is duplicated work, but it's fast and convenient for the code.

# Checking Failures

Because the algorithm is generational, the only failures we care about are in the last generation to run. The first goal is to find the last generation:

Switch to the verification database on the meta cluster, the default database for this is migration_verification_metadata:


```
use migration_verification_metadata
db.verification_tasks.aggregate([{$sort: {'generation': -1}}, {$limit: 1}, {$project: {'generation': 1, '_id': 0}}])
```


Once we have the generation, we can filter on generation:


```
x = //generation from previous query
db.verification_tasks.find({generation: x, status: 'failed'})
```


Failed 'verify' tasks will look like the following:


```
  {
    _id: ObjectId("632c994915c7f27f0a3de33e"),
    generation: 15,
    _ids: [ 3, ObjectId("632c994915c7f27f0a3de55e"), 5, "hello" ],
    id: 0,
    status: 'failed',
    type: 'verify',
    parent_id: null,
    query_filter: { partition: null, namespace: 'test.t', to: 'test.t' },
    begin_time: ISODate("2022-09-22T17:20:12.388Z"),
    failed_docs: null
  }
```


Type `'verify`' denotes that this is a mismatch in documents. `_ids` lists the `_ids` of failing documents, which may be of any bson type. The `query_filter` `'namespace'` field is the source namespace, while the `'to'` field is the namespace on the destination.

Any collection metadata mismatches will occur in a task with the type '`verifyCollection`', which looks like the following:


```
  x = 0
  db.verification_tasks.find({generation: x, status: 'mismatch'})
  {
    _id: ObjectId("632c9c9f5c71ad5eb4fde2bd"),
    generation: 0,
    _ids: null,
    id: 0,
    status: 'mismatch',
    type: 'verifyCollection',
    parent_id: null,
    query_filter: { partition: null, namespace: 'test.t', to: 'test.t' },
    begin_time: ISODate("2022-09-22T17:34:23.441Z"),
    failed_docs: [
      {
        id: 'x_1',
        field: null,
        type: null,
        details: 'Missing',
        cluster: 'dstClient',
        namespace: 'test.t'
      }
    ]
  },
```


In this case, '`failed_docs`' contains all the meta data mismatches, in this case an index named '`x_1`'.
